- 👋 Hi, I’m @QuarrelsomeToad
- 👀 I’m interested in Botany and Ecology. I am not really great at programming, but I am very keen to learn and improve my skills!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different statistical skillsets in R and other digital platforms. I have recently discovered R Markdown, GitHub, and LaTeX.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my MSc project data analysis and the 'smoothening' of my R code.
